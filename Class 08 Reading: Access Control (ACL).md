# ***Read: Class 08 - Access Control (ACL)***

***

## **RBAC definition:**

    It is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization. The system needs of a given workforce are analyzed, with users grouped into roles based on common job responsibilities and system access needs. Access is then assigned to each person based strictly on their role assignment. With tight adherence to access requirements established for each role, access management becomes much easier.

## **Benefits of RBAC:**

- The assignment of access rights becomes systematic and repeatable.

- It is much easier to audit user rights, and to correct any issues identified.

- RBAC may sound intimidating, but it can in reality be easy to implement, and will make the ongoing management of access rights much easier and more secure.

- The data breach you prevent may be your own.

## **RBAC vs. ABAC vs. ACL**

There are some alternatives for/variations of RBAC, including:

- Access control lists (ACL):

        An ACL is a means of defining access rights by a given user or user group, to a specific object, such as a document.  As a simple example, an ACL could be used to allow users from one department to make changes to a document, while only allowing users from other departments to read the document.

- Attribute-based access control (ABAC):

        sometimes known as policy-based access control, can use a variety of attributes, including user department, time of day, location of access, type of access required, etc. to determine whether a userâ€™s access request should be granted.

- Role Based Access Control (RBAC):

        Both of these options provide additional granularity of controls beyond the basic concept of RBAC, but can also greatly expand the effort required to create and maintain the necessary permissions.  RBAC arguably offers a more simplified and manageable approach, given that the privileges of a user in a given position are granted with a simple effort, to all others in the same role.  These methods can, however, be used in tandem to increase control.

### **RBAC implementation:**

The following simplified five-step approach to getting it implemented:

1. Inventory your systems:

    Figure out what resources you have for which you need to control access, if you don't already have them listed. Examples would include an email system, customer database, contact management system, major folders on a file server, etc.

2. Analyze your workforce and create roles:

    You need to group your workforce members into roles with common access needs.  Avoid the temptation to have too many roles defined. Keep them as simple and stratified as possible.

3. Assign people to roles:

    Now that you have a list of roles and their access rights, figure out which role(s) each employee belongs in, and set their access accordingly.

4. Never make one-off changes:

    Resist any temptation to make a one-off change for an employee with unusual needs. If you begin doing this, your RBAC system will quickly begin to unravel. Change the roles as required or add new ones when really necessary.

5. Audit:

    Periodically review your roles, the employees assigned to them, and the access permitted for each. If you discover, for example, that a role has unnecessary access to a particular system, change the role and adjust the access level for all employees in that role.
